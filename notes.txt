1. almost everything in JS is an object (name value pairs)
2. primitive value types: string, bool, num, null, undefined, symbol
3. reference type: object (has a pointer, then space where object is stored in memory)
4. variable: something that can change it's value/ holds a value
5. object literal notation: {a:10, b:true, c:"hello"} (an array of key:value pairs separated by commas and surrounded by curly braces)
6. variable declaration: var, let const (last 2 from ES6)
7. JS is a dynamically (not static) typed language!!
