## Notes on Babel

### Compiled vs interpreted languages

- compiled language: program code -> compiler -> machine code (run)
- interpretated language: program code -> interpreter (engine) -> machine code (running whole time) ✨ JavaScript

### Transpiler

- a compiler that trnaslates code from one programming language to another with the same level of abstraction ✨ Sass -> CSS | Python -> JavaScript

### Compiling vs transpiling

(levels of abstraction from high to low)

- JS, Python, PHP (horizontal is transpile, top down is compiling)
- C/C++, Java
- Assembly, Bytecode
- Machine Code

✨ JavaScript is the most popular implementation of the ECMAScript standard

- V8, SpiderMonkey, ActionScript (other ECMAScript implementations)

### What Babel Does:

- Transform JavaScript to JavaScript
- Babel is a transpiler and compiler
